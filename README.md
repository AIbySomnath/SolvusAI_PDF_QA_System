# SolvusAI: Llama3-Powered PDF Q&A 🚀📄
 
## 📌 Introduction
SolvusAI is an advanced AI-powered PDF Q&A system leveraging **Llama3** and **Groq API** to enable intelligent document processing. This application allows users to **upload PDF files**, **extract insights**, and **interact via a chatbot** to receive accurate and context-aware responses.

With **cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **state-of-the-art embeddings**, this system efficiently processes large PDF documents, retrieves relevant information, and provides precise answers to user queries.
